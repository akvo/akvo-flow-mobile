Akvo FLOW app release notes
===========================
# ver 2.2.9
Date: 24 November 2016

# New and noteworthy
* **Add possibility to update the app from the settings screen** - [#500] You can now go to the Settings screen and check for updates for the app and whenever you chose so.
* **Improvements to login screen** [#469]  - We have made it easier to navigate between text input fields. Use the softkeyboard keys to go the the next field and to send the data when all done.
* **Remove the text input field for barcode questions when manual input disabled** [#460] - We removed the confusing non editable text input when manual input is not allowed.
* **Facilitate debugging using the same debug key** [#509]
* **Allow debugging the app directly from Android Studio** [#491] - We have made it easier to debug directly using android studio and provided instructions in the wiki.
* **Moved non translatable strings to a separate file** [#480]
* **Added unit tests support** [#305] - You can now run unit tests, just follow instructions provided in the wiki.

# Resolved issues
* **When device is rotated do not show the user is logged in** [#498] - We no longer show the Toast message saying the user has been logged in every time the device is rotated.
* **Surveys with the same name failed with manual transfer** [#476] - We have fixed the issue and you can have multiple forms with the same name and manually transfer them with all the questions displayed correctly.
* **Added translations when there was an error synchronising a file** [#487] - We have provided translations for this error message.
* **Do not check for notifications before deviceId is set** [#484] - This is the second part of [#454] and prevents the device from syncing if there is no deviceId set.

---------------
# ver 2.2.8
Date: 8 November 2016

# New and noteworthy
* **Nepali translations** [#330] - We have introduced Nepali as a new language in the app, and in addition updated translations in a number of the other languages [#478]

* **Use new Flow app icon** [#466] - We have updated the Flow icon in line with the new Akvo-wide design guidelines

* **Caddisfly question type** [#421] - As part of the [integration of the Akvo Caddisfly app with Akvo Flow](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-product-design/issues/5), the app now recognises a `caddisfly question` as a new question type

# Resolved issues
* **Do not check for new surveys before Device ID is set** [#454] - This fixes the issue where it was not possible to identify a device in the dashboard because it was missing the user-defined device identifier.  This was caused by the app connecting to the dashboard *before* the identifier was setup correctly within the app, and as a result, transmitting an empty field instead of the device identifier

* **Remove unused geopoint code** [#461] - A cleanup of the system to remove unused parts of the application

Overview
----
This release contains improvements to the FLOW Field Survey application related to the storage of files on the device, a new keystore for app generation for easier installation of updates, and a new feature to allow users to scan barcodes from within a survey on the application.

New features & enhancements
----
### New feature: Barcode question type in surveys
A new question type that allows users to scan a barcode from inside their FLOW survey while collecting data in the field. The user selects the question type from the Survey Manager on the Dashboard when creating a survey, and then on the device this question prompts the user to "Scan Barcode," which calls an external barcode scanning app, and then populates the text field with the barcode number. REQUIRES an external barcode scanning app to be installed on the device. Barcode scanning apps that have been tested for this feature are: ZXing and QuickMark.

GitHub issues:
[17](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/issues/17), [59](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/issues/59)

### Enhancement: Enable users to store large numbers of surveys and photos on device SD card
Users can now store very large numbers of survey zip files and photos on their device's SD card. This is necessary when data collectors are going for long periods offline, where surveys must be stored on the devices for later upload. Since there is a limit for the number of files that can be stored in each directory independent of SD card storage capacity, this is achieved using a new file structure that distributes the files into multiple directories, instead of just storing them in the SD card root directory as before.

GitHub issue:
[16](https://https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/issues/16)

### Enhancement: New keystore for apk generation to eliminate signature conflicts
Created and distributed a release keystore along with instructions for use so that there is a single signature for the Field Survey application. This solved the problem from previous versions where, when multiple keystores were used to generate the app, users would face a signature conflict when trying to update the app on the device that forced them to uninstall the existing app before installing an update.

GitHub issue:
[21](https://https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/issues/21)


Bug fixes
----
### Email address of user not displayed correctly in user management

GitHub issue:
[51](https://https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/issues/51)


Known Issues
----
### Compatibility issues with Android OS version 2.1

Barcode Scanning
External barcode scanning apps (QuickMark, ZXing) crash or freeze in Android OS 2.1. As a result, we have not made this feature available for the apk running on 2.1. You can still enter barcodes manually into surveys when a barcode question type is present.

GPS Status App
Cannot reliably launch GPS Status app from inside the Field Survey application running on Android OS 2.1 (Settings > GPS Status).

#ver 1.9.35

* Gray out "Scan Barcode" button in apk running on OS 2.1 (#59)
* Fixed bug where email address of user not displayed correctly in user management
* Create initial test scripts for the apk (#37)
* Modify apk signature to eliminate signature conflicts that forced some users to uninstall before updating application (#21)
* Add ability to scan barcodes from app (#17)
* Fixed a defect where device users that exceeded the SD card file directory limits were losing data when directories were full (16)
*
